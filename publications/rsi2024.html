					<h1>Design and performance of indium seals for size-constrained tunable laser spectrometers</h1>
					<div class="article">

						<h1>Abstract</h1>
						<p>Indium seals have been used extensively in ultra-high vacuum and cryogenic applications. 
							Typically, these seals use indium alongside or in place of other metal gaskets in stainless-steel 
							vacuum flanges, with some custom applications for flanges sealing directly with glass (optics or 
							tubes). Here, we present the design and performance of three pressed indium seals (99.99% In) 
							between aluminum and 0.5 in. diameter sapphire optics and aluminum and gold coated Kovar 
							semiconductor packages (TO-66 and TO-39). Test fixtures were designed to mimic those of future 
							tunable diode laser spectrometers for Earth, planetary, and manned spaceflight environmental 
							monitoring applications. Successful high-hermeticity seals [less than 10−10 atm cc/s (He)] were achieved 
							for all seals formed with sufficient pressure applied to allow indium to flow between mating 
							surfaces. The hermeticity of the seals was maintained after temperature cycling (−10 to +80 °C, 
							20 cycles), with the optical seals surviving extended duration tests (−55 to +85 °C, 
							per MIL-STD-883). Semiconductor packages (TO-39) subjected to these extended tests saw a 
							moderate increase in leak rate [∼5 × 10−9 atm cc/s (He)]; however, further testing showed that 
							either the glass-metal package seals or the indium were affected (the sample size was too small 
							to draw firm conclusions for future applications). Overall, these results suggest long-term 
							survivability of indium seals for Kovar–aluminum and sapphire–aluminum interfaces [>10 years at 
							10−10 atm cc/s (He)], where the coefficient of thermal expansion differs by approximately four times.</p>
