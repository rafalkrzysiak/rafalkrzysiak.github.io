					<h1>Information-Based Control of Robots in Search-and-Rescue Missions With Human Prior Knowledge</h1>
					<div class="article">

						<h1>Abstract</h1>
						<p>Multirobot systems provide a scalable and robust solution for monitoring tasks. In time-intensive 
							missions such as search and rescue, the inclusion of a human has the potential advantage of 
							incorporating prior knowledge about the target location or dynamics. In this article, we develop 
							a general information-theoretic framework to control multiple autonomous robots in search and 
							rescue missions that include a human teleoperator. Human prior knowledge is modeled to capture 
							the target location and dynamics, and mutual-information-based control is formulated to let 
							autonomous robots weigh between two strategies: independent search or assisting the human by 
							staying in proximity. The control actions optimize a weighted sum of normalized mutual information 
							calculated using particle-filtered estimates of the target and the reference robot. We implement 
							the framework to simulate two widely different scenarios designed after search-and-rescue missions 
							from literature, and incorporate varying levels of accuracy in human prior knowledge. Our results 
							indicate that the mission performance depends on how robots weigh between the two strategies, with 
							the amount of the optimal control effort shared between strategies affected by prior knowledge and 
							the number of robots. Comparison with existing strategies points to the benefits of an 
							information-based control in situations where human prior knowledge is inaccurate. The proposed 
							information-theoretic abstraction of the humanâ€“robot interaction can be implemented on a wide 
							variety of scenarios and the results highlight the role of human prior knowledge toward effective 
							robotic assistance in time-intensive missions.</p>
